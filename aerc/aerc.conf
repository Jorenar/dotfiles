#
# See time.Time#Format at https://godoc.org/time#Time.Format
#
# Default: 2006-01-02 03:04 PM (ISO 8601 + 12 hour time)
timestamp-format=2006-01-02 03:04 PM

#
# Width of the sidebar, including the border.
#
# Default: 20

# Default: (no folders)
empty-dirlist=(no folders)

# Enable mouse events in the ui, e.g. clicking and scrolling with the mousewheel
#
# Default: false
mouse-enabled=false

[viewer]
#
# Specifies the pager to use when displaying emails. Note that some filters
# may add ANSI codes to add color to rendered emails, so you may want to use a
# pager which supports ANSI codes.
#
# Default: less -R
pager=less -R

#
# If an email offers several versions (multipart), you can configure which
# mimetype to prefer. For example, this can be used to prefer plaintext over
# html emails.
#
# Default: text/plain,text/html
alternatives=text/plain,text/html

#
# Default setting to determine whether to show full headers or only parsed
# ones in message viewer.
#
# Default: false
show-headers=false

#
# Layout of headers when viewing a message. To display multiple headers in the
# same row, separate them with a pipe, e.g. "From|To". Rows will be hidden if
# none of their specified headers are present in the message.
#
# Default: From|To,Cc|Bcc,Date,Subject
header-layout=From|To,Cc|Bcc,Date,Subject

# Whether to always show the mimetype of an email, even when it is just a single part
#
# Default: false
always-show-mime=false

[compose]
#
# Specifies the command to run the editor with. It will be shown in an embedded
# terminal, though it may also launch a graphical window if the environment
# supports it. Defaults to $EDITOR, or vi.

# Default header fields to display when composing a message. To display
# multiple headers in the same row, separate them with a pipe, e.g. "To|From".
#
# Default: To|From,Subject
header-layout=To|From,Subject

[filters]
#
# Filters allow you to pipe an email body through a shell command to render
# certain emails differently, e.g. highlighting them with ANSI escape codes.
#
# The first filter which matches the email's mimetype will be used, so order
# them from most to least specific.
#
# You can also match on non-mimetypes, by prefixing with the header to match
# against (non-case-sensitive) and a comma, e.g. subject,text will match a
# subject which contains "text". Use header,~regex to match against a regex.
subject,~^\[PATCH=awk -f /usr/share/aerc/filters/hldiff
#text/html=/usr/share/aerc/filters/html
text/plaintext=awk -f /usr/share/aerc/filters/plaintext
#text/html=$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/aerc/external-browser
text/html=elinks -dump
text/*=awk -f /usr/share/aerc/filters/plaintext
image/*=feh -

[triggers]
#
# Triggers specify commands to execute when certain events occur.
#
# Example:
# new-email=exec notify-send "New email from %n" "%s"<Enter>

#
# Executed when a new email arrives in the selected folder
