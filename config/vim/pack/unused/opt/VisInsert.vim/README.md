VisInsert
=========

[Visual-block Insert][v_b_I] is great, innit?  
But why doesn't it work in [visual][v] and [visual-line][_V_] modes?  
And why does it only allow to add text?  
Why deleting text isn't propagated to the rest of lines?  
Why moving cursor just ruins the edit?  

And that's why this simple plugin exists
